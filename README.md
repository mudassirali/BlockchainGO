UDEMY - "Golang: How to Build a Blockchain in Go Guide" Follow Along

I have a great interst in learning Blockchain and  working as a Product Manager for blockchain and/or Web3 companies.vIn order to gain a foundation level understand of blockchain infrastructure, I looked to Udemy and used Golang to understand how blocks, transactions, wallets and nodes all work togeather. 

Along the path of learning Golang and Blockchain, I deviated my the intstructor led course and redesigned the packages to what made most sense to me. For example, the Udemy instructor verified transactions at the transaction level whereas I felt it was more appropriate to verify transactions sent at the Wallet level.
